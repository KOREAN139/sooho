id: CVE-2018-17071
title: "Breking PRNG in Lucky9io"
description: >
  The fallback function of a simple lottery smart contract implementation for Lucky9io, an Ethereum gambling game, generates a random value with the publicly readable variable entry_number. This variable is private, yet it is readable by eth.getStorageAt function. Also, attackers can purchase a ticket at a low price by directly calling the fallback function with small msg.value, because the developer set the currency unit incorrectly. Therefore, it allows attackers to always win and get rewards.
