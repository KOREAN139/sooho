# Reporting Security Issues

Sooho strongly believes the responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities in open source helps user privacy and security. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security issue, email [security@sooho.io](mailto:security@sooho.io) and include the word "SECURITY" in the subject line.

We will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, the security team will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement and may ask for additional information or guidance.

Report the security bugs in third-party modules to the person or team maintaining the module. You can also report a vulnerability through the [Sooho Vulnerability Disclosure](https://goo.gl/forms/BFB76kc0q0Q2a7PN2) program.
